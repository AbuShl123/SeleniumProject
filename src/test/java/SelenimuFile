</> When do we have a NoSuchElementException?
        - Wrong locator
        - Synchronization: when driver and browser are not on same page, driver will try to find a web element that
          is not loaded yet. If it happens it will throw NoSuchElementException

</> .click():
        1) What does it do?
            - It clicks to given WebElement
        2) Does it accept any arguments?
            - NO.
        3) Does it work just by itself? (driver.click()0
            - driver.findElement(By.***).click();

        4) Difference between click and submit method?
            -click() -> Perform only click operation as like mouse click
            -submit() -> Perform Enter operation as like keyboard Enter event

</> .sendKeys()
        1) What does it do?
            - It will pass the provided String into given element
        2) Does it accept any argument?
            - Yes accepts a String argument
            - We can pass Keys commands into sendKeys() method as well
        3) Keys.ENTER:
            - This piece of code will imitate use passing ENTER from keyboard

</> .getText()
        1) What does it do?
            - It will get the content from in between opening and closing tags
        2) What is return type?
            - String
        3) does it accept any argument?
            - No

        syntax: driver.getText() <- we cannot do that
                driver.findElement(By.***).getText() <- now this is correct

</> .getAttribute("Attribute name")
        1) What does it do ?
            - find the matching attribute and returns its value
        2) What is a return type?
            - String
        3) Does it accept any argument?
            - It accepts String arg
